In this paper we use a newly developed structural model of the Irish property and credit market to examine the implications of these measures for house prices and key activity variables in the mortgage market.","type":4,"repository_link":"http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/10419\/129421","pdf_link":"https:\/\/www.econstor.eu\/bitstream\/10419\/129421\/1\/824628845.pdf"}','5382b838d60abd95849430ebf8c97ffe');
INSERT INTO record VALUES(19741,'This paper discusses the role that finance plays in promoting the capital development of the economy, with particular emphasis on the current situation of the United States and the United Kingdom. We define both "finance" and "capital development" very broadly. We begin with the observation that the financial system evolved over the postwar period, from one in which closely regulated and chartered commercial banks were dominant to one in which financial markets dominate the system. Over this period, the financial system grew rapidly relative to the nonfinancial sector, rising from about 10 percent of value added and a 10 percent share of corporate profits to 20 percent of value added and 40 percent of corporate profits in the United States. To a large degree, this was because finance, instead of financing the capital development of the economy, was financing itself. At the same time, the capital development of the economy suffered perceptibly. If we apply a broad definition-to include technological advances, rising labor productivity, public and private infrastructure, innovations, and the advance of human knowledge-the rate of growth of capacity has slowed. The past quarter century witnessed the greatest explosion of financial innovation the world had ever seen. Financial fragility grew until the economy collapsed into the global financial crisis. At the same time, we saw that much (or even most) of the financial innovation was directed outside the sphere of production-to complex financial instruments related to securitized mortgages, to commodities futures, and to a range of other financial derivatives. Unlike J. A. Schumpeter, Hyman Minsky did not see the banker merely as the ephor of capitalism, but as its key source of instability. Furthermore, due to "financialisation of the real economy," the picture is not simply one of runaway finance and an investment-starved real economy, but one where the real economy itself has retreated from funding investment opportunities and is instead either hoarding cash or using corporate profits for speculative investments such as share buybacks. As we will argue, financialization is rooted in predation; in Matt Taibbi''s famous phrase, Wall Street behaves like a giant, blood-sucking "vampire squid." In this paper we will investigate financial reforms as well as other government policy that is necessary to promote the capital development of the economy, paying particular attention to increasing funding of the innovation process. For that reason, we will look not only to Minsky''s ideas on the financial system, but also to Schumpeter''s views on financing innovation.','78a6d1bda1e567ed2afdaafaa3364b6a260a821b626a9fa7390e67a83ec9bd04',NULL,1,'http://hdl.handle.net/10419/146965','https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/146965/1/826724841.pdf','Financing the capital development of the economy: A Keynes-Schumpeter-Minsky synthesis',4,2015,'{"id":19741,"title":"Financing the capital development of the economy: A Keynes-Schumpeter-Minsky synthesis","creators":"Mazzucato and Wray","subjects":["Economics","Financial Economics","Economic Development","Innovation","Regulation","Development","Technological Change","Growth","Economic Growth","Aggregate Productivity","Policy","Debt","Financial Institutions","Finance","Research","History Of Economic Thought","Services","Industrial Policy","Deficit","Intellectual Property Rights","Planning","Financial Crisis 2007","National Budget","Monetary Economics","Industrial Structure","Fluctuations","Current Heterodox Approaches","Capitalist Systems"],"year":2015,"abstract":"This paper discusses the role that finance plays in promoting the capital development of the economy, with particular emphasis on the current situation of the United States and the United Kingdom.

In other words, what is needed is a Schumpeterian-like, nonmechanical view about long waves, where Minsky''s financial Keynesianism is integrated with Marx''s focus on capitalist relations of production. Both are essential elements in understanding neoliberalism''s ascent and collapse. Minsky provided crucial elements in understanding the capitalist \"new economy.\" This refers to his perceptive diagnosis of \"money manager capitalism,\" the new form of capitalism that came from the womb of the Keynesian era itself. It collapsed a first time with the dot-com crisis, and a second time, and more seriously, with the subprime crisis. The focus is on the long-term changes in capitalism, and especially on what L. Randall Wray appropriately calls Minsky''s \"stages approach.\" Our aim is to show that this theme has a deep connection with the topic of the socialization of investment, central in the conclusions of the latter''s 1975 book on Keynes.","type":4,"repository_link":"http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/10419\/110013","pdf_link":"https:\/\/www.econstor.eu\/bitstream\/10419\/110013\/1\/813068347.pdf"}','99792efaf10972802c2103a5cc2e9123');

INSERT INTO record VALUES(24159,'Since the 2008 financial crisis, in which the Reserve Primary Fund "broke the buck," money market funds (MMFs) have been the subject of ongoing policy debate. Many commentators view MMFs as a key contributor to the crisis because widespread redemption demands during the days following the Lehman bankruptcy contributed to a freeze in the credit markets. In response, MMFs were deemed a component of the nefarious shadow banking industry and targeted for regulatory reform. The Securities and Exchange Commission''s (SEC) misguided 2014 reforms responded by potentially exacerbating MMF fragility while potentially crippling large segments of the MMF industry. Determining the appropriate approach to MMF reform has been difficult. Banks regulators supported requiring MMFs to trade at a floating net asset value (NAV) rather than a stable $1 share price. By definition, a floating NAV prevents MMFs from breaking the buck but is unlikely to eliminate the risk of large redemptions in a time of crisis. Other reform proposals have similar shortcomings. More fundamentally, the SEC''s reforms may substantially reduce the utility of MMFs for many investors, which could, in turn, affect the availability of short term credit. The shape of MMF reform has been influenced by a turf war among regulators as the SEC has battled with bank regulators both about the need for additional reforms and about the structure and timing of those reforms.

To this end, we rely on a multivariate fractionally integrated asymmetric power autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity dynamic conditional correlation framework, which accounts for long memory, power effects, leverage terms, and time-varying correlations. The empirical analysis shows a contagion effect for Brazil and Mexico during the early stages of the global financial crisis, indicating signs of \"recoupling.\" Nevertheless, linkages show a general pattern of \"decoupling\" after the Lehman Brothers collapse. Furthermore, correlations between Brazil and the US are decreased from early 2009 onwards, implying that their dependence is larger in bearish than in bullish markets.","type":0,"doi":"10.1080\/23322039.2014.963632","repository_link":"http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/10419\/147732","pdf_link":"https:\/\/www.econstor.eu\/bitstream\/10419\/147732\/1\/23322039.2014.963632.pdf"}','3a41e7e65430173613366d16e83d6963');

INSERT INTO record VALUES(35032,'Interbank markets for term maturities experienced great stress during the 2007-09 financial crisis, as illustrated by the behavior of one- and three-month Libor. Despite widespread interest in these markets, little data are available on dollar interbank lending for maturities beyond overnight.

INSERT INTO record VALUES(45694,'The basic purpose of this study is to didactically demonstrate the factors shaping the currency swap stock of domestic banks prior to the crisis and to provide a descriptive analysis of how the structure and the functioning of the market changed during the crisis. The main conclusions of the study are as follows. In addition to the wide ranging applicability of the transaction, the rise in the currency swap stock of domestic credit institutions is also attributable to macroeconomic factors. The bulk of the exchange rate risk resulting from the high external borrowing requirement and rising external debt was carried by the domestic private sector, while the foreign sector shared a decreasing portion of the risk. The rapid increase in the swap stock was also due to the fact that the synthetic production of foreign currency funds with currency swaps was often more successful than the direct inflow of foreign currency funds. On the basis of the decomposition of the domestic banking system''s on-balance sheet foreign currency position, we can state that it increased mainly as a result of items that also increased the balance sheet total. Following the outbreak of the global financial crisis in the autumn of 2008, the conditions for ensuring foreign currency liquidity deteriorated significantly, which had a substantial effect on implied forint yields, and the turnover and structure of the swap market. While the total average turnover of the domestic FX swap market did not drop radically when the crisis was spreading, market liquidity did decline significantly for a few days and access to foreign currency liquidity became limited. The active role assumed by parent banks and shortening maturities contributed to moderating the decline in turnover. Anecdotal information relating to the tightening of counterparty limits vis-à-vis domestic banks is supported by the decline in the number of non-resident counterparties. The crisis also contributed to changes in the structure of the swap stock. The average remaining maturity of the gross stock began to decline directly after the Lehman bankruptcy, at the time of global dollar liquidity problems, followed by a rise starting from early 2009, principally owing to transactions concluded with parent banks.

From the temporal distributions of the clustered segments, we found that the Japanese economy never fully recovered from the extended 1997-2003 crisis, and responded to the most recent global financial crisis in five stages. Of these, the second and main stage affecting 21 industries lasted only 27 days, in contrast to the two-and-a-half-years across-the-board recovery from the 1997-2003 financial crisis. We constructed the minimum spanning trees (MSTs) to visualize the Pearson cross correlations between Japanese industries over five macroeconomic periods: (i) 1997-1999 (Asian Financial Crisis), (ii) 2000-2002 (Technology Bubble Crisis), (iii) 2003-2006 (economic growth), (iv) 2007-2008 (Subprime Crisis), and (iv) 2008-2010 (Lehman Brothers Crisis).

While these new principles are being debated, it is important to realize that in the face of unexpected developments that always arise in the financial sector, there is an important role for the exercise of judgment by both monetary authorities and financial regulators. Whereas considerable progress has been achieved on the principles governing this regulatory overhaul, very significant challenges remain on the implementation issues that will arise as a new regime takes hold globally.","type":4,"repository_link":"http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/10419\/53736","pdf_link":"https:\/\/www.econstor.eu\/bitstream\/10419\/53736\/1\/654911045.pdf"}','08fb32a8eb1e2de3772739b84d032112');

INSERT INTO record VALUES(53686,'In the last months, the world''s economies were confronted with the largest economic recession since the Great Depression. The occurrence of a worldwide financial market meltdown as a consequence originally stemming from of the crisis in the US subprime housing sector was only prevented by extraordinary monetary and fiscal policy measures implemented at the international level. Although the world economy seems now to be slowing recovering, it is worthwhile exploring the fragility and potentially destabilizing feedbacks of advanced macroeconomies in the context of Keynesian macro models. Fragilities and destabilizing feedback mechanisms are known to be potential features of all markets-the product markets, the labor market, and the financial markets. In this paper we focus in particular on the financial market. We use a Tobin-like macroeconomic portfolio approach, and the interaction of heterogeneous agents on the financial market to characterize the potential instability of the financial markets. Though the study of the latter has been undertaken in many partial models, we focus here on the interconnectedness of all three markets.

While modification terms are more favorable for weaker borrowers, greater reductions in mortgage payments and/or interest rates are associated with lower redefault rates.

The determinants of this volatility are assessed using Stochastic Volatility models to gauge the role played by liquidity risk, credit risk (financial and sovereign), and interest rate expectations. Our results suggest that liquidity risk is the main determinant of the volatility of the policy spread, but also that private bank credit risk has become more apparent in the post-Lehman collapse phase of the crisis for the euro area as financial CDS premia rose due to possible default fears. In addition, the ECB appears to have been more effective in addressing liquidity risk since the onset of the crisis, and this may be related to its greater direct access to a broader range of counterparties and its acceptance of a broader range of eligible collateral. The main implication is that, in crisis times, a sufficiently flexible operational framework for monetary policy implementation produces the most timely response to market tensions.','65474d2409316dc65982163f62dd0448edd1a147e46138aa41131d749c8d6b16',NULL,1,'http://hdl.handle.net/10419/39016','https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/39016/1/631013415.pdf','Liquidity risk, credit risk and the overnight interest rate spread: A stochastic volatility modelling approach',4,2010,'{"id":55425,"title":"Liquidity risk, credit risk and the overnight interest rate spread: A stochastic volatility modelling approach","creators":"Beirne et al.","subjects":["Economics","Diffusion Processes","Time-Series Models","Dynamic Treatment Effect Models","Dynamic Quantile Regressions","Monetary Policy","EU Countries","State Space Models","Central Banks","Great Britain","Financial Crisis","Volatility","Credit Risk","Yield Structure","Financial Crisis 2007","Risk Premium","Bank Liquidity","Interest Rate Policy","Money Market","Stochastic Volatility"],"year":2010,"abstract":"In this paper we model the volatility of the spread between the overnight interest rate and the central bank policy rate (the policy spread) for the euro area and the UK during the two main phases of the financial crisis that began in late 2007.

INSERT INTO record VALUES(58079,'The subprime financial crisis has forced several North American and European central banks to take extraordinary measures and to modify some of their operational procedures. These changes have made even clearer the deficiencies and lack of realism in mainstream monetary theory, as can be found in both undergraduate textbooks and most macroeconomic models. They have also forced monetary authorities to reject publicly some of the assumptions and key features of mainstream monetary theory, fearing that, on that mistaken basis, actors in the financial markets would misrepresent and misjudge the consequences of the actions taken by the monetary authorities.

INSERT INTO record VALUES(64125,'We provide robust evidence of deviations from the covered interest rate parity (CIP) relation since the onset of the financial crisis in August 2007. The CIP deviations exist with respect to several different dollar-denominated interest rates and exchange rate pairings of the dollar vis-à-vis other currencies. The results show that our proxies for margin conditions and for the cost of capital are significant determinants of the CIP deviations. Following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, uncertainty about counterparty risk became a significant determinant of CIP deviations. The supply of dollars by the Federal Reserve to foreign central banks via reciprocal currency arrangements (swap lines) reduced CIP deviations.
